# üåº Extended Iris Flower Classification Project

This is my third mini project in **Data Science and Machine Learning** as part of the **Let's Grow More Internship** program. In this project, I extended the classic **Iris Flower Classification** by applying a **Decision Tree Classifier** and visualizing the decision-making process of the model graphically.

## üìä Project Overview

The **Iris Dataset** is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, often used for classification tasks. The dataset consists of 150 samples with four features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The goal is to classify these samples into one of three iris species:

1. **Iris Setosa**
2. **Iris Versicolour**
3. **Iris Virginica**

## üîç Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset and performed data cleaning.
- Standardized the features for consistent model performance.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

### 2. Model Building with Decision Tree Classifier
- Implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier** for the classification task.
- Tuned hyperparameters to enhance the model's accuracy.
- Visualized the structure of the Decision Tree to interpret the decision-making process.

### 3. Visualization of the Decision Tree
- Used **Graphviz** and **Matplotlib** to graphically represent the trained Decision Tree.
- Provided insights into how the model splits data based on feature values, offering a clear understanding of its decision-making rules.

## üìà Results
The **Decision Tree Classifier** achieved high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling this well-structured dataset. The graphical representation of the tree helped visualize the decision-making process, making the model easier to interpret.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and decision tree plotting.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the Decision Tree Classifier and evaluating model performance.
- **Graphviz**: For visualizing the Decision Tree structure.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Experiment with other tree-based algorithms like **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** to compare performance.
- Implement feature importance analysis to understand which features contribute the most to classification.
- Explore deeper hyperparameter tuning for improved model accuracy.
